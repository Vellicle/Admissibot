Let's keep this short and in the tradition of modern law school teachings, easy to read, as enforceable as possible in relevant jdxes, and open to questions. This License, although not necessarily in this particular format or file name, must remain with any other file that was first commited to https://github.com/Vellicle/Admissibot/new/master on August 10, 2016.
1. If any part of the following end user or developer license warrants questions, negotiations, or any sort of contact, please, email us, administrator@vellicle.com or admin@estoppel.io and we promise we won't bite.
2. Intent: The intent for the code or aseembled binaries, web-applications, APIs, or any other form of the serieses of codes that may appear here or in other places in question (hereonafter CODE) is partly a proof of concept - meaning that the conceptual aspect of determining admissibility purely on existing caselaw and statutes and regs can be done and a testbed to see the efficiency of such operations, meaning that it actually works in a way that is streamlined enough to beat out an objective test legal researcher, which shall be defined as one who have taken the required legal research courses in law school and have at least attemped to complete a JD, understands the methods of legal research, but not necessarily the advaned courses taught in different styles at different schools with different focuses. It's not intended for production use and please do not rely on it for anything with actual liability including but not limited to actual litigation, actual arbitration, actual anything, law school work, anythin with consequences that may cause damage. In exchange for the license to use, distribute, and modify the code, the bargained-for consideration would be the indemnification of the developer(s). Yes, this is a twist on the promise-not-to-sue doctrine in employee handbooks.
3. Modification of code: Much of the source is public domain US government work (FRE). Any non public source code is subject to US and your local copyright laws as usual. Vellicle-MJZX LLC and its serialized entities, members, and managers may only have the right to license the use and modification of original code, original meaning that they created, typed, or assembled in some way that does not involve in any intentional way code written by others - there is no way to avoid standardized code conventions and some will invariably overlap. You may modify and use the CODE freely for noncommercial and attributed use without further valuable consideration. Attribution is defined as either a direct link to any repository, website, email address, or other place where Vellicle or its members, subsidiaries, d/b/as, could be contacted directly without any intermediary forms, i.e. a 3rd party site, except for github, gitbucket, or any other developer's platform directly accessible and linked to the organization or its members. 
3a. Attribution to its developers may only be replaced by the phrase "This work would only be possible if Professor Ann Murphy at Gonzaga University School of Law made the FRE actually interesting and cool. Thank you, professor Murphy, even if and perhaps especially because you took such joy in your work with the IRS as well, administrative law is and can be fun." This verbatim phrase should be in place regardless as a comment in some file but may replace a direct attribution named in part 3. Otherwise no license shall be granted.
4. One modifies the FRE on their own at their own peril. Please do not change any part that interacts with the federal rules without prior consulting with the developers, even if you have a JD, even if you are an Esq. Even if you're Canadian. 
5. Any monetary contribution towards the work in progress is considered a donation or more casually a "thank you" or "good job" or "hey this is cool" and does not grant further rights, except I might thank you back. We accept crypto as well as fiat currency, precious metals, services, and other negotiable instruments if, well, negotiated, and yes we know that's not what negotiable instruments refers to. You may find our Bitcoin address at 3J1wRR5wJQxSz76W93MEjXjpf5jZFvxcqR and shoot us a note for other means.
6. Don't use this in court or to cheat, this is mostly just to see if the code can be binary enough to weigh the elements. If you've been in front of a real evidentiary hearing you'd know that the judge sometimes makes crazy calls.
7. DMCA is crap, so uh, anyone a fan of the Lanham Act? Jdx is D.Nev or E.D. or S.D. of NY (see commentary below).
8. If you do not agree with the terms and would like to use it, ask and we can talk. Bargained for exchange, right?
9. [Insert Boilerplate except integration because you don't want something unfinished to already integrate in case something else coms up].
10. In exchange for access to said CODE you are effectively disclaiming all liability where laws allow, and acknowledging that you are aware of the fact that your waiver's ineffectuality is enabled only by the lack of laws allowing you to if you cannot disclaim such liability. (See commentary).
Commentary soon - D. Nevada (Zappos) v. SDNY - (Netscape) and why living and working in Vegas and Brooklyn makes the situation a bit awkward for us, and really, need more sensible laws (and more sensible licenses).
