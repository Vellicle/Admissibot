TODO: THis should probably be somewhere else but this is good for now:

FRE had some changes that came into effect over the winter but by now it looks like we can go ahead:

Note: This will likely work more sensibly on an individual level as some sort of reactive webapp under UIKit or Foundation or something, but a dialogue based bot interface should work.... almost the same way. Don't bother with state first (outside of Cali it's all pretty much following the same thing with minor differences, we can find those easily). 

I'm split between whether this should be split into testimonial/nontestimonial right away or deal with it later and split civil/criminal. The gap is clearer between crim/civil so splitting it that way might work better for a start, but we'll seee.

The upside-down pyramid scheme of the FRE also poses a challenge since it goes from broad to narrow, but we can diagram that out.

- Criminal case or civil, A or B. 

Branch A:

A1 (relevance and non-relevant evidence being used) - is this evidence being used to prove of the truth of the matter asserted?
Y --> GOTO B (START WEIGHT OF PROBATIVE/PREJUDICE COUNTER) (this will need a ton of tweaking)
N --> GO TO A2 --> Is it being offered for something else...

To be continued
